Examples of exothermic reactions include burning of fuel, rusting of metal, and the formation of carbon dioxide and water from sugar. Examples of endothermic reactions include the combustion of fuel, the formation of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen, and the synthesis of glucose from carbon dioxide and water.\n\nTo distinguish between exothermic and endothermic reactions, we can look at the heat energy released or absorbed by the reaction. If heat energy is released, it is an exothermic reaction, and if heat energy is absorbed, it is an endothermic reaction. Another way to distinguish between them is to look at the products of the reaction. Exothermic reactions produce heat and light, while endothermic reactions produce heat and no light. A real-world example of an exothermic reaction is the burning of fuel, such as wood or gasoline, which produces heat and light.

For example, a supervised learning algorithm might be used to predict a person's credit score based on their income, debt-to-income ratio, and other factors. \n\nUnsupervised learning is used to find patterns in data without any labels or outcomes. For example, a clustering algorithm might be used to group customers based on their purchase history. \n\nReinforcement learning is used to optimize a system's performance over time. For example, a reinforcement learning algorithm might be used to optimize a robot's path to a goal. \n\nReal-world examples of machine learning include:\n- Image recognition: Google's ImageNet competition uses machine learning to identify objects in images. \n- Natural language processing: Amazon's Alexa uses machine learning to interpret voice commands. \n- Autonomous driving: Tesla's Autopilot uses machine learning to detect and avoid obstacles."], "ratios": [0.05319148936170213], "average_times": [0.0721480482858969]}], "tstamp": 1719285402.6781845}
